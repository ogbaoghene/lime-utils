lime-utils
==========

## A collection of lean Sass utilities.

Inspired by projects like [SCUT](http://davidtheclark.github.io/scut), [Sassifaction](https://github.com/sturobson/sassifaction), and [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io), lime-utils is for those who are all about maximizing their time in the zone and doing more quicker. Leveraging upon the already formidable powers of Sass, lime-utils brings together a collection of lean and highly useful Sass modules. Functions, mixins and placeholders that help organize code and avoid repetition; saving time and helping you stay in the zone longer.
